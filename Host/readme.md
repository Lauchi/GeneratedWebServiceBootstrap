## Getting started:

* Change the Schema.wsb according to your domain
* Open Package Manager Console
* run "cd ./Host"
* run "dotnet wsb"
* run ".\Resetdb.ps1"

Service will build now and SQlite Database is functional.

## Troubleshooting:
Attention: All generated Functions still throw NotImplementedExceptions, so implement them to be able to operate.
